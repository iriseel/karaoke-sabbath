                    Magic makes desire real through the power of repetition. Folding a thousand paper cranes heals a loved one. Reciting a mantra 108 times purifies karma. Saying one thing across a lifetime will one day make it true. In the present, where religious forms of invocation have become faded in legitimacy, what better way to harness the power of repetition than through karaoke?

                    Sing along to lyrics that have been sampled from millenia of curses and blessings, and in doing so, make these bygone wishes come true.
