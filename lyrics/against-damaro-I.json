    "I bind down …, Nikoklea's … fellow; I bind down Damaro, Thynno's wife; let no work bring advantage to Damaro; let Pythokritos drag the evil and miserable Damaro down - evil indeed and miserable!", 
    "And the evil and miserable Zopyros; let earth release no fruit for Zopyros nor for Thynnos, let the sea stop being liquid for him alone.",
    "I write down the evil and miserable Nikoklea: let there be no wedding and no bridal song for Nikoklea.", 
    "I write down the evil and miserable Damaro.", 
    "Let Pythokritos drag the evil and miserable Zopyros down, and let Pythokritos drag the evil and miserable Nikoklea down.", 
    "I write down the evil and miserable Antigonos, let him fade deprived of his companion [and his youth (?)]; down with him!"
