    "I hand over to Demeter and Korē the person who has accused me of preparing poisons against my husband. Let him go up to Demeter, burnt internally by fever, with all his [family], publicly confessing.",
    "And let him not find Demeter, Korē or the gods with Demeter to be merciful. For me let everything be holy and free. Let it be allowed for me to be safe when under the same roof or involved with him in any way.", 
    "And I hand over also the person who has written charges against me or commanded others to do so. And let him not find Demeter, Korē, or the gods with Demeter merciful, but may he go up burnt internally by fever together with all his family.",
    "I, Hegemonē, am [dedicating] the bracelet, which I lost [in the] gardens of Rhodokles, to Demeter and Korē and all the gods and goddesses with them.", 
    "If he gives it back, may all things be lawful and free for him and for those who recovered the reward and for me, because I recover  the bracelet  and for  him,  because he gave it back.",  
    "But if  he does [not] return it and if it is sold,  for him let there be anger from Demeter,  Korē and  all the gods and goddesses who are with them.",
    "I also dedicate to Demeter and Korē anyone who may have overcharged me if I have paid more than was due for the weight which I requested; mistress, may it be lawful for me.",
    "I dedicate to Demeter and Korē the man who unsettles my home, both him now and all of his possessions.  But may it be lawful and permissible for me in every way."
